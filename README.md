### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matt


## ðŸš€ About Me

I am Matthew Munoz, a Full-Stack Developer based in San Diego, CA. As a former High School Teacher turned Full-Stack Developer, I am passionate about continuous learning, mentoring others, and challenging myself to acquire new skills. My journey into the world of tech began with a curiosity for how websites and applications were built. Since then, I have immersed myself in learning everything from front-end development to back-end technologies. My experience in the classroom has made me an effective communicator and taught me the importance of adaptability and problem-solving, skills that I bring to my work as a developer. I enjoy using my expertise to create innovative solutions and am always looking for ways to challenge myself and grow as a professional.
